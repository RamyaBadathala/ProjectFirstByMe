## 🛠️ Data Cleaning Steps Performed

Using Microsoft Excel, the following data cleaning steps were undertaken:

- ✅ Identified and removed missing values, particularly in income and registration date fields
- ✅ Corrected data types to ensure consistency
- ✅ Standardized categorical variables for uniformity
- ✅ Removed duplicate records to maintain data integrity
- ✅ Created new features to aid in analysis

📌 Future Work
This project lays the foundation for deeper customer analytics. Possible next steps:

🔍 Perform clustering (e.g., K-Means) for customer segmentation using Python.

📈 Build an interactive dashboard using Power BI or Tableau.

🤖 Apply predictive models to forecast customer response or churn.

📤 Automate data cleaning using Python (Pandas).
