✅ Cleaned Dataset Summary:
📦 Original Dataset (Raw) Issues Contained missing values in key columns like Income and Dt_Customer had duplicate records.

Text fields (e.g., Education, Marital_Status) had inconsistent casing and spaces.

Dates were not standardized (some unreadable or misformatted).

Column names were inconsistent (e.g., uppercase, spaces).

Data types were incorrect for some fields (e.g., income as string, date as object).

🧹 What We Did – Cleaning & Preprocessing

Steps:
1️⃣	Removed rows with missing critical values (Income, Dt_Customer).
2️⃣	Removed duplicate rows to ensure each customer is unique.
3️⃣	Standardized text fields by lowercasing and trimming extra spaces.
4️⃣	Converted Dt_Customer to proper datetime format (dd-mm-yyyy).
5️⃣	Renamed all columns to lowercase and used underscores instead of spaces for consistency.
6️⃣	Ensured correct data types (e.g., Year_Birth as int, Income as float, Dt_Customer as datetime).
7️⃣	Resized the Dt_Customer column in Excel so dates are visible.

📊 Cleaned Dataset Now Includes:
✅ Accurate and consistent column formatting

✅ Proper data types for all fields
